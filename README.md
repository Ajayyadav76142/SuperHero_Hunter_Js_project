This is a super hero hunter website made by html,css,javascript and bootstrap.so this is a website where you can search about any super hero's and know their details
and also if you like a super hero then you can also add him in your favourite section.
I use bootstrap for making my website and also responsive for any device.
I use prior javascript for all functionalities like search hero,show hero's details, add in favourites and also remove from favourites.

⭐ Introduction
This project is Super Hero Hunter App in which we use superheroAPI() to fetch the records and details of all the superheroes along with some additional features. It is built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript.

Users can Mark their Favourite Super Heroes in the 'favourites' section. It is stored persistently in the browser's local storage.

Users are able to Search for the Super Heroes by entering the name or searchable-term in the Search Input. It shows a list of results as autocomplete suggestions, which upon clicking directs us to that particular superhero card with all the information provided by the SuperHero() API.


❗ Note
Please wait for 15 seconds for the API to load properly as it is in the Free Tier. Then you can start searching.
If the search bar still doesn't work then just refresh the page 2 times & it'll work  :)
